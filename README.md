The much needed Pyramid-based, Redis-backed, URL Shortener!

## Aims
This URL shortener aims to be a highly performant piece of software which you
can use at home. I'm also aiming for it to be completely extensible in an easy
way. Basing it on Redis allows for the server to be highly performant in
responses. Furthermore, basing it on pyramid allows for the shortener to be
highly extensible. It is able to have it's views, css, and html easily
overriden!
